# MTB-MLE-IM-Phonic-Game
This is the source code for my Phonic Game as project for my MTB-MLE subject in BEED course. It serves primarily as an instructional material and as a learning tool for students when uploaded to a website. This code has been tested to run without internet just by opening index.html file using a browser. 

A CSS boilerplate was used (https://html5boilerplate.com/ ) to maximize compatibility of layout on different browser and devices. 

logic is primarily done using vanilla javascript. The code is not optimized since I am just new to the programming language.

to use, you can download https://github.com/jepes1981/MTB-MLE-IM-Phonic-Game/archive/refs/tags/project.zip, extract it in a directory and doubleclick on index.html.
